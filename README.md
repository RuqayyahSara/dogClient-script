# dogClient-script

Watch Dog client script to generate Tokens and send System Information to the watch Dog server.

## Execution
The above script does not require Node JS to run the application. I am using an npm, pkg, that packages node applications to JavaScript executables/binaries and this can be run on any target machine. 

### STEPS TO EXECUTE

Go to the terminal and type
1. npm i
2. pkg app.js
This will generate binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac machines
Execute any of the binaries based on the OS you are using, for example, in case of Linux, type -
3. ./app-linux

And the above script will execute
You can also uninstall Node JS from your machine and check for yourself that the binaries will execute even without it.
